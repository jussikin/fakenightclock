Fakenightclock is replacement for typical nightclock. It is essentially a display that when movement is seen will show contentents of display buffer for a while. When movement is no longer detected it will clear the display. It will display message from mqtt topic so it is neccesssary to have mqtt server and something that publishes to that topic. I use this to publish clock and some temperature data.

Code itself should be quite easily modifiable to different hardware and display configurations.
